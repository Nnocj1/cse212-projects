/* Always refer to this method when i want to examine the big O of a number of methods expected
to complete the same task. Through this means, I will come to know the one that is energy, memory, and 
time saving. As such more efficient code.

Analysis: it is very clear by using as shown in the example below that using a logarithmic performance,
I could improve the big O far better than a linear or polynomial performance. Nonetheless, a linear performance
is also far better than a polynomial performance. So I'm thinking that as much as possible,  would work hard to
ensure that all my functions that perform linearly or polynomial would be converted to a logarithmic performance.

For now I will not stress too much to learn all that it takes to build exactly this, instead use it often and get familiar. With time I would rewrite all 
of this myself. Using my own formulas to test.

Benefits or Use: I feel that this is a very profitable or useful knowledge as it guides me to write better algorithms to tackle problems.
And it becomes a good foundation to test softwares and make recommendations for their improvement. I may
also choose to go back in time to examine some of the algorithms I wrote and work hard to improve them.*/
